This project aims to enhance the efficiency of solar panels by integrating a thermoelectric module 12706 at the backside of the panel. The goal is to capture waste heat generated by the panel and convert it into additional electrical power using the thermoelectric module. This innovative approach leverages the properties of thermoelectric materials to generate electricity from temperature gradients, ultimately increasing the overall energy output of the solar panel.

### 💡 Project Description

- **🔧 Components:**
  - Solar Panel
  - Thermoelectric Module 12706
  - Heat Sink (for temperature gradient)
  - Electrical Wiring and Measurement Instruments

- **🔍 Working Principle:**
  - The solar panel generates heat due to its operation under sunlight.
  - The waste heat at the back of the solar panel can be captured using the thermoelectric module 12706.
  - The thermoelectric module converts the temperature difference between the heat sink and the back of the panel into electrical power.
  - This additional electrical power is then fed back into the solar panel system, enhancing overall efficiency.

- **⚙️ Wiring and Setup:**
  - The thermoelectric module 12706 is mounted at the back of the solar panel with adequate heat sink support.
  - Electrical connections are established to measure the power generated by the thermoelectric module.
  - Appropriate configurations and adjustments are made to ensure optimal power output.
